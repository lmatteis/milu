#An Italian cooking site

This project is simply the codebase for versioning my work done for
[milu](http://milu-app.appspot.com).

It's completely written in JavaScript (even server-side code) and uses
 the [ApeJS](https://github.com/lmatteis/apejs/) framework, therefore it will
 only run on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/).

- Best of luck

Luca
